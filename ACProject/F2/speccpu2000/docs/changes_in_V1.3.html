<p>SPEC CPU2000 V1.3 is intended to be the final release of SPEC CPU2000.
It responds to problems that have arisen in the nearly 4 years since the
previous release, improves compatibility, and improves stability.</p>

<p>Changes include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Updates to 9 benchmarks, primarily due to portability issues on
     new platforms 
 <li>Additional toolsets to support newer platforms
 <li>Refreshes for the sources of the tools, and fixes for the buildtools
     procedures, to make it easier to build tools in the future if and where
     needed
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>New systems supported</h2>
With this release of SPEC CPU2000, new support is added for:
<ul>
<li>MacOS X on Intel hardware
<li>GLIBC 2.2+-based 64-bit x86-64 systems
<li>RedHat AS3+ and SuSE 9+ Linux on Itanium-based systems
</ul>

<h2>Systems no longer supported</h2>

<h2>Documentation Updates</h2>

All of the documents with ".txt" extensions now have CRLF line-endings for
the convenience of Windows users.  Other documentation updates include:
<ul>
<li><a href=tools_build>tools_build</a> (and <a href=tools_build.txt>tools_build.txt</a>),
    which have been updated to reflect changes due to the tools source update.
<li><a href=install_guide_unix.html>install_guide_unix.html</a> which has been
    updated to reflect a small change in the installation scripts
<li><a href=../Revisions>Revisions</a>, which contains a detailed list of all changes
    made to v1.3.
</ul>

<h2>Tools source updates</h2>

<p>The tools sources have been updated to make building the tools on
new systems easier.  The build system has also been updated to catch
errors during the tools build process that would have previously gone
unreported.</p>

<h2>Tools updates</h2>

<p>The <tt>monitor_wrapper</tt> facility has been modified to not execute during
training runs for builds using feedback-directed optimization.</p>

<h2>Changes to benchmarks</h2>

The following benchmark changes were made in V1.3:
<ul>
<li>176.gcc: A potentially problematic uninitialized variable error has been
             fixed.  Additionally, several problems relating to building
             176.gcc with newer versions of GCC have been fixed:
    <ul>
    <li>The value for <tt>OBSTACK_INTERFACE_VERSION</tt> has been changed
        to -1 in order to allow 176.gcc to build on 64-bit systems with GCC.
    <li>Uses of the cast as lvalue extension have been removed in order to
        allow compilation using GCC 3.5.0 and later.
    <li>A prototype for <tt>exact_log2_wide</tt> was added to correct a type
        mismatch which was causing sign-extension problems on 64-bit MacOS X
        systems.
    <li>A workaround for a bug in varargs support in the Windows 64 PSDK for
        x86-64 was added.
    <li>Added portability defines for 64-bit Solaris/x64
        (<tt>SOLARIS_X64</tt>) and other systems which need to have
        <tt>alloca.h</tt> included (<tt>SPEC_CPU2000_NEED_ALLOCA_H</tt>).
    </ul>
<li>186.crafty:
    <ul>
    <li>Eliminated common global symbols; this allows GCC to build it even in
        the presence of the <tt>-fno-common</tt> switch.
    <li>Added portability defines for Solaris/x86 (<tt>SOLARIS_X86</tt>) and
        Solaris/x64 (<tt>SOLARIS_X64</tt>)
    </ul>
<li>187.facerec: In fft2d.f90, don't check the shape of FTemp until after we
                 first ensure that it exists.
<li>188.ammp: Added a function prototype and added an explicit return type
              to a function declaration to quiet a couple of warnings.
<li>191.fma3d: Changed the name of one output file so that it can be
               automatically deleted.  This works around a race condition seen
               on Windows which could cause multi-copy rate runs to fail.
<li>252.eon: Several changes were made to enhance standards compliance:
  <ul>
  <li>The <tt>cerrno</tt> header file is now included unless
      <tt>SPEC_CPU2000_NO_ERRNO_MACRO</tt> is defined.  This is necessary for
      environments which do not export <tt>errno</tt> by default.
  <li>The local version of <tt>fmax()</tt> has been renamed to avoid conflict
      with library functions of the same name.
  <li>Wrappers for <tt>iostream.h</tt> and <tt>fstream.h</tt> have been
      provided for systems that no longer support "legacy" headers in C++.
  </ul>
<li>253.perlbmk:
  <ul>
  <li>Added defines for MacOS X on PowerPC and Intel-based systems.
  <li><tt>SPEC_CPU2000_GLIBC22</tt> settings are now the default on Linux.
      They can be turned off by definining <tt>SPEC_CPU2000_NO_HAS_FGETPOS</tt>
      and <tt>SPEC_CPU2000_NO_HAS_FSETPOS</tt>.
  <li>Some platform-specific sources are usually selected automatically;
      Windows users wishing to get the non-Windows sources can set the
      environment variable <tt>SPEC_NOT_REALLY_WINDOWS</tt> to achieve this
      end.
  </ul>
<li>255.vortex: Added code to set two closed file pointers to NULL in order
                to avoid attempting to use them for output.  Also fixed a
                comment bug which claimed that a <tt>long</tt> on P64 systems
                was 8 bytes.
<li>300.twolf: 
    <ul>
    <li>Some calls to <tt>free()</tt> were being passed two parameters; this
        has been fixed.
    <li>Eliminated common global symbols; this allows GCC to build it even in
        the presence of the <tt>-fno-common</tt> switch.
    </ul>
</ul>
