To run and install SPEC CPU2000, you will need:

<ol>
   <li><p> A computer system running UNIX or Windows (NT-derived). 
      (See the 
     <a href=#port><font color=blue>Portability Note</font></a> below)</p>

   <li><p> A CD-ROM drive </p>

   <li><p> 256MB of RAM.  Attempting to run the suite with less memory
      is strongly discouraged, as you will end up measuring the 
      speed of your paging file, not the speed of your CPU.</p>

      <p>More memory will be needed if you run multi-user SPECrates.</p>

   <li><p> Disk space:</p>

       <ul>
        <li> Typically 2GB of disk space to install and run the suite.  </p>

        <li> More disk space will be needed if you plan to maintain a large 
          set of binaries. </p>

        <li> More disk space will be needed if you plan to run SPECrates 
          with multiple copies.  Note that SPECrates must be run using 
          a single file system, so large runs will likely require some
          form of hardware or software disk striping.</p>

        <li> Minimum requirement: It is possible to run with about 800MB 
	  to 1GB of disk space if you are running only single-CPU 
	  metrics and if you clean up the run directories between 
	  experiments; see <a href=runspec.html>runspec.html</a> for 
          more information.  </p>

<li><i>The </i><tt><big><b>$SPEC/docs/    </b></big></tt><i> directory on a Unix
 system where SPEC CPU2000 has been installed.
<li>   The </i><tt><big><b>%spec%\docs.nt\</b></big></tt><i> directory on a Wind

PEC CPU2000 distribution cdrom.</i>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

</center>

        </ul></p>

   <li><p> Since SPEC supplies only source code for the benchmarks, you will
      need either:
<pre>
       a. A set of compilers for the result(s) you intend to measure:

          1) For SPECint2000: Both C and C++ compilers
          2) For SPECfp2000:  Both C and Fortran-90 compilers

       --or--

       b. A pre-compiled set of benchmark executables, given to you
          by another user of the same revision of SPEC CPU2000, and
	  any run-time libraries that may be required for those 
	  executables.</p>
</pre>

      <p>Please notice that you cannot generate a valid CPU2000 result
      unless you meet all of requirement 5.a.1 or 5.a.2 or 5.b.  For
      example, if you are attempting to build the floating point suite
      but lack a Fortran-90 compiler, you will not be able to measure
      a SPECfp2000 result.</p>
</ol>


<a name=port><h2>Portability Notes</h2></a>

   SPEC CPU2000 is a source code benchmark, and portability of that source
   code is one of the chief goals of SPEC CPU2000.  SPEC has invested 
   substantial effort to make the benchmarks portable across a wide variety 
   of hardware architectures, operating systems, and compilers.  During the 
   development of SPEC CPU2000 V1.0, testing was done on 7 different hardware 
   architectures, 11 versions of Unix (including 4 Linux versions) and two 
   versions of Windows/NT.  

   <p>During the development of SPEC CPU2000 V1.2, many of these 
   operating systems were re-tested, and in some cases newer versions
   of the operating systems were tested.  In the Windows family, testing
   included Windows Advanced Server, Windows XP, and Windows 2000.
   (Notice that SPEC CPU2000 is not compatible with versions of
   Windows that are not derived from Windows NT.  For example, SPEC
   CPU2000 <u>cannot</u> be expected to work on Windows 95, Windows 98, 
   Windows 3.1, or Windows Me.)

   <p>Despite SPEC's testing efforts, certain portability problems are
   likely to arise from time to time.  For example:
    <ul>

       <li> Some platforms may not have a Fortran-90 compiler available.

       <li> Some older compilers may not include all the features 
         needed to run the entire suite.

       <li> Sometimes, a new release of a compiler or operating system 
         may introduce new behavior that is incompatible with one
         of the benchmarks.
    </ul>

   <p>If you visit <a href=http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/>http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/</a>  
   and look up results for SPEC CPU2000,
   you will find combinations of OS and compiler versions that are known
   to work.  For example, if a vendor reports a SPECint2000 result on
   the SuperHero 4 using SuperHero Unix V4.0 with SuperHero C V4.0 and
   SuperHero C++ V4.0, you may take that as an assertion by the vendor
   that the listed versions of Unix, C, and C++ will successfully
   compile and run the SPEC CINT2000 suite on the listed machine.

   <p>For systems that have not (yet) been reported by vendors, SPEC can
   provide limited technical support to resolve portability issues. 
   See <a href=techsupport.txt>techsupport.txt</a> 
   for information.
