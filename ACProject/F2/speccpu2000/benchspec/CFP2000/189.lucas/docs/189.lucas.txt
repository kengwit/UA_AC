SPEC CPU2000 Benchmark Description File

Benchmark Name: 189.lucas

Benchmark Author: Ernst Mayer

Benchmark Program General Category: Number theory: primality testing

Benchmark Description: 

Performs the Lucas-Lehmer test to check primality of Mersenne numbers
2^p-1, using arbitrary-precision (array-integer) arithmetic. 
Accomplishes the Mersenne-mod squaring via the discrete weighted
transform technique of Crandall and Fagin (Math. Comp. 62 (205), 
pp.305-324, January 1994).  Uses a data-local, cache-friendly FFT to
efficiently perform the large-integer squaring of the Lucas-Lehmer
iterations.

Input Description: Attempt to prove the primality of a large number.

Output Description: The proof (or disproof) is not completed in the 
time allotted for the benchmark.  Therefore, a hex residue is provided 
to verify that the algorithm is on track towards the proof (or disproof).

Programming Language: Fortran-90

Known portability issues:  none
