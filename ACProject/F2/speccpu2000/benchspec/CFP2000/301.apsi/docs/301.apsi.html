<H2>Benchmark Description</H2>

<P>Program to solve for the mesoscale and synoptic variations of potential
temperature, U AND V wind components, and the mesoscale vertical velocity W
pressure and distribution of pollutants C having sources Q.  The synoptic scale
components are in quassi-steady state balance, while the mesoscale pressure and
velocity W are found diagnostically.</P>

<P>The solution of the complete system is performed by using the splitting-up
method.  In specific the horizontal advection is carried out by an explicit
leapfrog scheme, the horizontal diffusion is performed by the method of the
eigenvalues, or equvalently by vertical multiplying the fourier coefficients by
appropriate exponentials.  The vertical diffusion is treated with a
semi-implicit pade-crank-nickolson, as well as the vertical advection.  The
pressure derivative terms are treated with the so-called pressure averaging
technique.  Finally other terms will be dubbed in the advection part
(coriolis).  The model calculates prognostically the the potential temperature,
U,V wind components and concentrations of pollutants C (POTT,UX,VY,C).  The
pressure and the vertical velocity will be calculated diagnostically (PRES,WZ).
The diffusivities are also calculated diagnostically using information on
UX,VY, POTT.</P>
