SPEC CPU2000 Benchmark Description File

Benchmark Name: 172.mgrid

Benchmark Author: Eric Barszcz, Paul O. Frederickson

Benchmark Program General Category: Multi-grid Solver: 3D Potential Field

Benchmark Description:

  172.mgrid demonstrates the capabilities of a very simple multigrid
  solver in computing a three dimensional potential field.

  Adapted by SPEC from the NAS Parallel Benchmarks with modifications
  for portability and a different workload.

Input Description:

  1. It solves only a constant coefficient equation,
     and only on a uniform cubical grid.

  2. It solves only a single equation, representing
     a scalar field rather than a vector field.

Output Description:

  In addition to echoing some of the inputs, the main part of the output
  is from the smoothed approximate inverse.  Only a small fraction of the
  smoothed output is printed, just enough to assure that all work is being
  done and at to check intermediate results for accuracy.  In addition the
  L2 norm and Inf norms are are used as a checksum of the output.

Programming Language: Fortran 77

Known portability issues: None
