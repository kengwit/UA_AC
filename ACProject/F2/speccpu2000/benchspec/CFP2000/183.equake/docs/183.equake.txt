SPEC CPU2000 Benchmark Description File

Benchmark Description:
183.equake
 
Benchmark Authors:
David R. O'Hallaron and Loukas F. Kallivokas
 
Benchmark Program General Category: 
Simulation of seismic wave propagation in large basins
 
Benchmark Description: 
The program simulates the propagation of elastic waves in large,
highly heterogeneous valleys, such as California's San Fernando
Valley, or the Greater Los Angeles Basin. The goal is to recover the
time history of the ground motion everywhere within the valley due to
a specific seismic event. Computations are performed on an
unstructured mesh that locally resolves wavelengths, using a finite
element method.

Input Description: 
The input data comprises the unstructured grid topology, i.e., number
of nodes, number of tetrahedral elements, node coordinates, and
element connectivity, the seismic event characteristics, i.e. duration
and seismic source specifics, material properties, and the structure
of the sparse system matrix. The underlying reference problem is the
simulation of 1994 Northridge Earthquake aftershock in the San
Fernando Valley of Southern California.

Output Description: 
The output file contains a case summary with seismic source data and
reports the motion (displacements) at both the hypocenter and
epicenter of the earthquake for a predetermined number of simulation
timesteps. The output file format is ASCII.
