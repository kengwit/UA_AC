Benchmark Program General Category: 
----------------------------------

Physics / Quantum Chromodynamics


Benchmark Description:
---------------------

"wupwise" is an acronym for "Wuppertal Wilson Fermion Solver", a program
in the area of lattice gauge theory (quantum chromodynamics).

Lattice gauge theory is a discretization of quantum
chromodynamics which is generally accepted to be the fundamental
physical theory of strong interactions among the quarks as
constituents of matter. The most time-consuming part of a
numerical simulation in lattice gauge theory with Wilson
fermions on the lattice is the computation of quark propagators
within a chromodynamic background gauge field. These
computations use up a major part of the world's high performance
computing power.

Quark propagators are obtained by solving the inhomogeneous
lattice-Dirac equation. The Wuppertal Wilson Fermion Solver
(wupwise) solves the inhomogeneous lattice-Dirac equation via
the BiCGStab iterative method which has established itself as a
method of choice.

A more detailed characterization of the program can be found in the
Postscript file "wupwise.ps" in the "docu" subdirectory.


Input Description: 
-----------------

The input file wupwise.in contains a few parameters from which the
problem is built, among them:
	SEED	seed value for a random number generator which
		supplies initial data
	NITER	number of iterations
	KAPPA	parameter characterizing the matrix M = I - KAPPA * D


Output Description: 
------------------

The main output file is "wupwise.out", containing a check value (EPS)
for each the NITER iterations, and a final value EPSILON characterizing
the BiCGStab result.

In addition, there is a file "te.out", containing the value
"TRUE EPSILON". Since this value (in the magnitude of 0.6E-5) has been 
found to vary more between systems, it is written to a separate file
for which the SPEC-imposed accuracy requirements are different from
those required for the main output file (see values $reltol in
file 168.wupwise/Spec/object.pm).


Programming Language: 
--------------------

Fortran 77, with the change that (as in all of SPEC's Fortran benchmarks)
the type
	DOUBLE PRECISION
has been replaced by
	REAL*8	,
thus making the size of the relevant floating-point data uniform
across systems - an important consideration for fair benchmarking.
While the type REAL*8 is not part of the strict FORTRAN77 or Fortran90  
standards, it is a common language extension recognized by
all Fortran compilers the SPEC CPU subcomittee has used in its tests.


Known portability issues: 
------------------------

The source code as prepared by SPEC contains FORTRAN77 versions of
common LINPACK BLAS functions (zaxpy.f, zcopy.f, zdotc.f, zgemm.f, zscal.f).
According to the CPU2000 Run and Reporting Rules (2.1.2), the level 1, 2, 
and 3 BLAS functions may be substituted by precomputed (library-based)
subroutines (compilation for peak runs only, not for baseline runs).
For the case that this is not done (e.g., for baseline runs, or if
optimized libraries are not available), all BLAS functions needed by 
the benchmark are provided in the source directory.

Note that since these source functions were taken unchanged from the 
respective source code libraries, the spelling of their names has been 
retained: They are defined in the files z*.f in lower case, but called in
upper case. For Fortran compilers that insist on a strict FORTRAN77
standard (which only recognizes upper-case letters in identifiers),
a suitable portability flag like
	-fu	Convert all lower-case identifiers to uppercase
may be necessary.
