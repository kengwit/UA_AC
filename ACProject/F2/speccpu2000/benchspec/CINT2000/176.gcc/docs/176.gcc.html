<H2>Benchmark Author</H2>
<P>Richard Stallman and a large cast of helpers.

<H2>Benchmark Program General Category</H2>
<P>C Language optimizing compiler</P>
<HR>

<H2>Benchmark Description</H2>
<P>176.gcc is based on gcc Version 2.7.2.2. It generates
code for a Motorola 88100 processor. The benchmark runs
as a compiler with many of its optimization flags
enabled. 176.gcc has had its inlining heuristics
altered slightly, so as to inline more code than would
be typical on a Unix system in 1997. It is expected that
this effect will be more typical of compiler usage
in 2002. This was done so that 176.gcc would
spend more time analyzing it's source code inputs,
and use more memory. Without this effect, 176.gcc would
have done less analysis, and needed more input
workloads to achieve the run times required for
SPECint2000.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Input Description</H2>
<P>There are 5 input workloads in 176.gcc (compared with
57 in the 126.gcc of SPECint95). All these files are
preprocessed C code (.i files); integrate.i and expr.i
come from the source files of gcc itself. 166.i is
made by concatenating the Fortran source files of a
SPECint2000 candidate benchmark, then using the f2c
translator to produce C code, and then pre-processing.
200.i comes via the same method from a previous
version of the SPECfp2000 benchmark 200.sixtrack,
and scilab.i comes via the same method from a version
of the Scilab program.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Output Description</H2>
<P>All output files are 88100 assembly code files.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Programming Language</H2>
<P>The code is in C.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Known portability issues</H2>
<OL>
<LI>The code needs to be aware of the endianness of
the host it runs on. 176.gcc will default to
little endian. To run correctly on a big-
endian machine, the flag HOST_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN
must be defined when the benchmark is compiled
(eg -DHOST_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN).
<LI>Some of the optimizations 176.gcc performs
require constant propagation of floating point
constants. These form an insignificant amount
of computation time, yet may depend on IEEE
floating point format to produce a correct
result.
<LI>176.gcc is not an ANSI C program. It uses
GNU extensions.
<LI>176.gcc is inherently a 32-bit program. It has
been successfully ported by SPEC to many 64-bit
UNIX implementations. However use of high
optimization levels with a 64 bit system in
conjunction with inlining of procedures from
different source files may reveal issues with
64-bit cleanliness with 176.gcc.
<LI>176.gcc has been changed slightly by SPEC to
build properly with newer versions of GCC.  If you're
using an old gcc (~2.6 or older) to build 176.gcc, you
should define the __OLDANDBUGGY__GNUC__ flag.
