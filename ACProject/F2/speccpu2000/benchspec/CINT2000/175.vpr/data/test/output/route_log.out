VPR FPGA Placement and Routing Program Version 4.00-spec
Source completed August 19, 1997.


General Options:
	Routing will be performed on an existing placement.

Routing Options:
	Combined GLOBAL + DETAILED routing will be performed.
	The router will try at most 30 iterations.
	Routings can go at most 3 channels outside their bounding box.
	Cost of a bend (bend_cost) is 0.
	First iteration sharing penalty factor (first_iter_pres_fac): 4
	Initial (2nd iter.) sharing penalty factor (initial_pres_fac): 8
	Sharing penalty growth factor (pres_fac_mult): 2
	Accumulated sharing penalty factor (acc_fac): 1
	Router will attempt routing only with a channel width factor of 15.
