VPR FPGA Placement and Routing Program Version 4.00-spec
Source completed August 19, 1997.


General Options:
	The circuit will be placed but not routed.

Placer Options:
	User annealing schedule selected with:
	Initial Temperature: 5
	Exit (Final) Temperature: 0.005
	Temperature Reduction factor (alpha_t): 0.9412
	Number of moves in the inner loop is (num_blocks)^4/3 * 2
	Placement cost type is linear congestion.
	Placement will be performed once.
	Placement channel width factor = 100.
	Exponent used in placement cost: 1
	Initial random seed: 1

Reading the circuit netlist from net.in.
Warning:  logic block #368 (n_n13961) has only 1 pin.
	Pin is an output -- may be a constant generator.  Non-fatal, but check this.
