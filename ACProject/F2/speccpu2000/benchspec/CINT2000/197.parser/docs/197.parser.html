<H2>Benchmark Description</H2>
<P>The Link Grammar Parser is a syntactic parser of English, based on link
grammar, an original theory of English syntax. Given a sentence, the
system assigns to it a syntactic structure, which consists of set of
labeled links connecting pairs of words. </P>

<P>The parser has a dictionary of about 60000 word forms. It has coverage
of a wide variety of syntactic constructions, including many rare and
idiomatic ones. The parser is robust; it is able to skip over portions
of the sentence that it cannot understand, and assign some structure to
the rest of the sentence. It is able to handle unknown vocabulary, and
make intelligent guesses from context about the syntactic categories of
unknown words.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Input Description</H2>

<P>The input is a sequence of proposed sentences, one per line.
Punctuation and case matter.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Output Description</H2>
<P>The output is an analysis of the proposed input sentence.  The
analysis includes a set of links which capture the grammatical structure
of the sentence, a labelling of each word with an appropriate part of
speech tag, along with a judgement of the grammaticality of the input
sentence.  Words in square brackets are ones that the parser deems
superfluous. </P>
<HR>

<H2>Programming Language</H2>
<P>The parser is written in ANSI C.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Known portability issues</H2>
<P>None</P>
