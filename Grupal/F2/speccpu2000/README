       Subject: Pointer to SPEC CPU2000 documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The documentation for SPEC CPU2000 may be found on the web, at

     www.spec.org/cpu2000/docs/

The documentation is also on your SPEC CPU2000 cdrom, in 
the top level directory "docs" or "docs.nt".  

Start with the document "readme1st.html".  

For example, on a Unix system with the SPEC CPU2000 CD mounted as 
/cdrom, you would point your web browswer at: 

     file:///cdrom/docs/readme1st.html

On a Windows/NT system, you would start Windows Explorer, and
then: 
    click on the plus sign next to your CD drive
    click on the directory docs
    double-click on readme1st.html
