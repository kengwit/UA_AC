-------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a single benchmark, let alone a suite of source code
benchmarks to provide a consistent, comparative measure of 
CPU-intensive performance, is not as simple as it may sound.
The challenges are numerous, for example: 
	- locating meaningful programs, 
	- ensuring that they port to numerous environments, 
	- defining rules to govern how the programs are compiled,
	  run and reported.
	- developing a harness to enforce these rules while 
	  still making things easy to use.
	- defining a process by which decisions can be made
	  amongst the group working on the project.

And in the end, you hope you have something that is fair, relevant, 
easy to use, understandable  and will address technology for a period 
long enough for you to start the next generation benchmark. 

Such is the case with SPEC CPU2000. While it did take longer than 
the 3 years originally envisioned, SPEC CPU2000 is a worthy update
and replacement for CPU95. Comparing CPU95 to CPU2000, it:
	- increases the number of applications and application
	  areas included in the suite. 
	- increases the high end stress on a system's memory 
	  subsystem.
	- improves the tools for running and using the suite,
	  not only for day to day benchmarking but for simulation
	  and analysis.
	- maintains the same basic run rules.
	- improves the documentation.

And all of this is due to the significant efforts of a large 
team of people from around the world, that I (and SPEC) would like
to thank (with apologies and thanks to those who I may have not 
listed):

- The many participants of the SPEC CPU2000 Search Program and,
  in particular, the authors that contributed programs that were
  made part of the suite:

	CINT2000 programs
	Name			Program
	Vaughn Betz		175.vpr
	Andreas Loebel		181.mcf
	Robert Hyatt		186.crafty
	Daniel Sleator		197.parser
	Martin Schonert		254.gap
	Peter Homan		255.vortex
	Julian Seward		256.bzip2
	Bill Swartz		300.twolf

	CFP2000 programs
	Bjoern Medeke		168.wupwise
	Brian Paul		177.mesa
	Alexander Gelfgat	178.galgel
	David O'Hallaron	183.equake
	Jan Vorbrueggen		187.facerec
	Robert Harrison		188.ammp
	Ernst Mayer		189.lucas
	Samuel Key		191.fma3d
	Eric McIntosh		200.sixtrack

  (For more information regarding these programs, see the 
   documentation in the individual benchmarks directories.)

- Additional authors/programmers who assisted with the applications:

	Name			Program
	Bill Licea-Kane		177.mesa
	Max Domeika		179.art
	Charles Robinson	179.art
	Peter Shirley		252.eon

- SPEC management, who while providing us resources, kept
  the SPEC CPU Subcommittee on their toes:

	Kaivalya Dixit - President, SPEC
	Larry Gray - Treasurer, SPEC
	Paula Smith, Jeff Garelick - Chairs, SPEC OSG
	Dianne Rice, Kathy Powers, Debbie Kuhn - Administration, SPEC
	Jason Glick - Webmaster, SPEC

- And last but most importantly, the people who sweated through 
  technical details and porting issues on a daily basis, 
  debated their view points vigorously, and were willing
  to drive issues to consensus. Without these people this benchmark
  suite would truly not exist:

	Les Barnes, Ryan Border, Paul Caprioli, Phil Ezolt, Paul 
	Koester, Jim Koehler, Carol LePage, Arrian Mehis, Greg 
	Mewhinney, Rahul Rahatekar, Ken Sarno, Wilfried Stehling, 
	Ken Sarno, Ahmad Zandi

	And the following people who not only contributed to the
	technical details and daily porting issues, but also made
	additional contributions:

	Chris Chan-Nui, Cloyce D. Spradling - tools
	John Henning - documentation 
	Michael Paton, Bodo Parady, Reinhold Weicker - insights 
	and wisdom from past SPEC development efforts
	
	
  Plus all of the people behind the scenes in the compiler groups,  
  architecture groups and performance groups who supported their 
  work for SPEC at their respective companies. Thank you!
