Introduction
------------

SPEC can provide limited technical support for:

- Installing CPU2000 on a UNIX or Windows NT system.
- Building the CPU2000 tools.
- Using the CPU2000 tools to run the benchmarks.
- Updates for known issues.


Before contacting SPEC
----------------------

Before contacting SPEC for support, it is suggested that you check 
the web site:

        http://www.spec.org/cpu2000 

for a list of questions that are frequently asked by users of the 
benchmark suite.

Also, please see the section "Troubleshooting" in 

       $SPEC/docs/config.html (Unix)   or
       %SPEC%\docs.nt\config.html (NT)


Contact Information
-------------------

SPEC CPU2000 technical support can be reached by sending email to:

     cpu2000support@spec.org

Additional/updated contact information can also be found at SPEC's
Web Site at: http://www.spec.org


Useful information to include when contacting SPEC
--------------------------------------------------

The following information should be provided to SPEC when requesting 
help with an issue:

- The revision of the benchmark suite that you're using ('runspec -V' output)
- The specific nature of the problem.
- Type of hardware/name of system being used.
- Name and version of the operating system.
- Name and version of the compiler.
- If a compilation issue:
	- list of flags being used
	- check if problems exist at lowest level of optimization.
- Has this issue been tried or seen on other systems?

Additional details related to the problem are also appreciated.



Limitations on support
----------------------

Note that while SPEC is able to provide technical assistance with its
benchmarks, SPEC does not have the ability to provide support
on other vendor's products. Examples of support that SPEC can not
provide include:

   - Hardware installation issues.
   - Hardware problems.
   - Non-SPEC software installation issues.
   - Non-SPEC software problems.
   - Hardware specific tuning.

If known, SPEC will provide a pointer to the appropriate source of
information.  Otherwise for these and similar issues, it is suggested 
that the hardware or software vendor be contacted directly.
