                         SPEC CPU2000: Changes in V1.3

    Last updated: 18-Aug-2005 cds

          (To check for possible updates to this document, please see
                      http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/docs/ )



   SPEC CPU2000 V1.3 is intended to be the final release of SPEC CPU2000. It
   responds to problems that have arisen in the nearly 4 years since the
   previous release, improves compatibility, and improves stability.

   Changes include:

     * Updates to 9 benchmarks, primarily due to portability issues on new
       platforms
     * Additional toolsets to support newer platforms
     * Refreshes for the sources of the tools, and fixes for the buildtools
       procedures, to make it easier to build tools in the future if and
       where needed

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

New systems supported

   With this release of SPEC CPU2000, new support is added for:
     * MacOS X on Intel hardware
     * GLIBC 2.2+-based 64-bit x86-64 systems
     * RedHat AS3+ and SuSE 9+ Linux on Itanium-based systems

Systems no longer supported

   With this release of SPEC CPU2000, support is removed for:
     * Reliant UNIX on MIPS-based systems
     * Linux on SPARC-based systems
     * Linux on Alpha-based systems
     * Windows on Alpha-based systems

          assume that you are reading the page from a directory that   
          also contains the other SPEC CPU2000 documents. If by some   
          chance you are reading this web page from a location where   
          the links do not work, try accessing the referenced

            * www.spec.org/cpu2000/docs/                               
            * The $SPEC/docs/ directory on a Unix system where SPEC    
              CPU2000 has been installed.                              
            * The %spec%\docs\ directory on a Windows system where     
              SPEC CPU2000 has been installed.                         
            * The docs/ or docs\ directory on your SPEC CPU2000        
              distribution CD-ROM.                                     

          -----------------------------------------------------------

Documentation Updates

   All of the documents with ".txt" extensions now have CRLF line-endings for
   the convenience of Windows users. Other documentation updates include:
     * tools_build (and tools_build.txt), which have been updated to reflect
       changes due to the tools source update.
     * install_guide_unix.html which has been updated to reflect a small
       change in the installation scripts
     * Revisions, which contains a detailed list of all changes made to v1.3.

Tools source updates

   The tools sources have been updated to make building the tools on new
   systems easier. The build system has also been updated to catch errors
   during the tools build process that would have previously gone unreported.

Tools updates

   The monitor_wrapper facility has been modified to not execute during
   training runs for builds using feedback-directed optimization.

Changes to benchmarks

   The following benchmark changes were made in V1.3:
     * 176.gcc: A potentially problematic uninitialized variable error has
       been fixed. Additionally, several problems relating to building
       176.gcc with newer versions of GCC have been fixed:
          * The value for OBSTACK_INTERFACE_VERSION has been changed to -1 in
            order to allow 176.gcc to build on 64-bit systems with GCC.
          * Uses of the cast as lvalue extension have been removed in order
            to allow compilation using GCC 3.5.0 and later.
          * A prototype for exact_log2_wide was added to correct a type
            mismatch which was causing sign-extension problems on 64-bit
            MacOS X systems.
          * A workaround for a bug in varargs support in the Windows 64 PSDK
            for x86-64 was added.
          * Added portability defines for 64-bit Solaris/x64 (SOLARIS_X64)
            and other systems which need to have alloca.h included
            (SPEC_CPU2000_NEED_ALLOCA_H).
     * 186.crafty:
          * Eliminated common global symbols; this allows GCC to build it
            even in the presence of the -fno-common switch.
          * Added portability defines for Solaris/x86 (SOLARIS_X86) and
            Solaris/x64 (SOLARIS_X64)
     * 187.facerec: In fft2d.f90, don't check the shape of FTemp until after
       we first ensure that it exists.
     * 188.ammp: Added a function prototype and added an explicit return type
       to a function declaration to quiet a couple of warnings.
     * 191.fma3d: Changed the name of one output file so that it can be
       automatically deleted. This works around a race condition seen on
       Windows which could cause multi-copy rate runs to fail.
     * 252.eon: Several changes were made to enhance standards compliance:
          * The cerrno header file is now included unless
            SPEC_CPU2000_NO_ERRNO_MACRO is defined. This is necessary for
            environments which do not export errno by default.
          * The local version of fmax() has been renamed to avoid conflict
            with library functions of the same name.
          * Wrappers for iostream.h and fstream.h have been provided for
            systems that no longer support "legacy" headers in C++.
     * 253.perlbmk:
          * Added defines for MacOS X on PowerPC and Intel-based systems.
          * SPEC_CPU2000_GLIBC22 settings are now the default on Linux. They
            can be turned off by definining SPEC_CPU2000_NO_HAS_FGETPOS and
            SPEC_CPU2000_NO_HAS_FSETPOS.
          * Some platform-specific sources are usually selected
            automatically; Windows users wishing to get the non-Windows
            sources can set the environment variable SPEC_NOT_REALLY_WINDOWS
            to achieve this end.
     * 255.vortex: Added code to set two closed file pointers to NULL in
       order to avoid attempting to use them for output. Also fixed a comment
       bug which claimed that a long on P64 systems was 8 bytes.
     * 300.twolf:
          * Some calls to free() were being passed two parameters; this has
            been fixed.
          * Eliminated common global symbols; this allows GCC to build it
            even in the presence of the -fno-common switch.

Configuration Files Updated

   All of the configuration files were updated.
