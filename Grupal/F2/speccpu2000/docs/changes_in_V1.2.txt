                         SPEC CPU2000: Changes in V1.2

    Last updated: 30-Oct-2001 jh

          (To check for possible updates to this document, please see
                      http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/docs/ )



New systems supported

   With this release of SPEC CPU2000, new support is added for:
     * MacOS X
     * Intel Itanium, using HP-UX
     * Intel Itanium, using Windows Advanced Server. Notice that:
          * Support for Windows Advanced Server required source code changes
            for several benchmarks. These changes are selected by setting the
            compiler option -DSPEC_CPU2000_P64
          * When installing the CPU2000 kit under Windows Advanced Server,
            you should set the CPU variable to "i386", as is pointed out in
            the updated install_guide_nt.html.

          Note: links to SPEC CPU2000 documents on this web page       
          assume that you are reading the page from a directory that   
          also contains the other SPEC CPU2000 documents. If by some   
          chance you are reading this web page from a location where   
          the links do not work, try accessing the referenced          
          documents at one of the following locations:                 
            * www.spec.org/cpu2000/docs/                               
            * The $SPEC/docs/ directory on a Unix system where SPEC    
              CPU2000 has been installed.                              
            * The %spec%\docs.nt\ directory on a Windows/NT system     
              where SPEC CPU2000 has been installed.                   
            * The docs/ or docs.nt\ directory on your SPEC CPU2000     
              distribution cdrom.                                      

          -----------------------------------------------------------

Documentation Updates

   Many of the documents have been moved to HTML format, in hopes that this
   will make them both easier to read and easier to navigate through. The
   HTML-format documents include:
     * runrules.html, which specify the rules for producing a valid SPEC
       CPU2000 result.
     * runspec.html, the document that describes the primary tool in the
       CPU2000 suite.
     * config.html, which describes how to write a config file. Config files
       are used by runspec.
     * system_requirements.html, which states the hardware and software
       prerequisites for SPEC CPU2000
     * install_guide_nt.html and install_guide_unix.html, which specify
       installation procedures
     * utility.html, which points out various useful utilities for advanced
       users

Run rule updates

   Several run rules have been newly adopted or clarified, including a rule
   on Fair Use. For additional details, see the Edit History at the top of
   runrules.html.

Tools updates

   The tools make several attempts to record additional information to log
   files and build directories, for example logging elapsed compile time even
   if the compile fails, logging the build type (base or peak), and logging
   the use of src.alt directories.

Changes to benchmarks

   In addition to the Windows Advanced Server changes mentioned above, the
   following benchmark changes were made in V1.2:
     * 186.crafty: Fixed a dangling comment delimiter
     * 252.eon: Improved standards compliance by fixing a source error
     * 253.perlbmk: added defines for Linux/S390 (32- and 64- bit); remove
       certain #undefs in spec_config.h, to allow portability defines; add
       some defines for glibc 2.2+ in spec_config.h and pp_sys.c.

Tools new features

   Two new styles of line continuation are now supported in config files:
   line can be continued with either a single backslash (\) or with a double
   backslash (\\).
     * When a single backslash is used, the field is recorded with an
       embedded new line.
     * When a double backslash is used, the field is recorded with no new
       line, but with the second line appended to the first.
   The following example illustrates both features:

     OPTIMIZE = -verbose -feedback=compile_time \\
                -optimize_level=aggressive
     notes100 = \\
        Crafty is compiled with both the compile-time  \
        feedback option and the aggressive optmization \
        option.

   The above example creates a single line for OPTIMIZE, with all three
   switches (-verbose, -feedback, -optimize_level). Also in the example,
   notes100 is defined as three lines of text.
