<h2>New systems supported</h2>
With this release of SPEC CPU2000, new support is added for:
<ul>
<li>MacOS X
<li>Intel Itanium, using HP-UX 
<li>Intel Itanium, using Windows Advanced Server.  Notice that:
    <ul>
    <li>Support for Windows Advanced Server required source 
        code changes for several benchmarks.   These changes
        are selected by setting the compiler option
          <tt><nobr>-DSPEC_CPU2000_P64</nobr></tt>
    <li>When installing the CPU2000 kit under Windows Advanced 
        Server, you should set the CPU variable to "i386", as 
        is pointed out in the updated 
        <a href=install_guide_nt.html>install_guide_nt.html</a>.
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation Updates</h2>
Many of the documents have been moved to HTML format, in hopes 
that this will make them both easier to read and easier to navigate through.
The HTML-format documents include:
<ul>
<li><a href=runrules.html>runrules.html</a>, which specify the rules 
    for producing a valid SPEC CPU2000 result.
<li><a href=runspec.html>runspec.html</a>, the document that describes 
    the primary tool in the CPU2000 suite.
<li><a href=config.html>config.html</a>, which describes how to write 
    a config file.  Config files are used by runspec.
<li><a href=system_requirements.html>system_requirements.html</a>, which
    states the hardware and software prerequisites for SPEC CPU2000
<li><a href=install_guide_nt.html>install_guide_nt.html</a> and
<a href=install_guide_unix.html>install_guide_unix.html</a>, which specify installation procedures
<li><a href=utility.html>utility.html</a>, which points out various
    useful utilities for advanced users
</ul>

<h2>Run rule updates</h2>
Several run rules have been newly adopted or clarified, including a rule 
on <a href=runrules.html#toc_4.7>Fair Use</a>.  For additional details, see 
the Edit History at the top of <a href=runrules.html>runrules.html</a>.


<h2>Tools updates</h2>

<p>The tools make several attempts to record additional information 
to log files and build directories, for example logging elapsed compile
time even if the compile fails, logging the build type
(base or peak), and logging the use of src.alt directories.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to benchmarks</h2>

In addition to the Windows Advanced Server changes mentioned
above, the following benchmark changes were made in V1.2:
<ul>
<li>186.crafty: Fixed a dangling comment delimiter
<li>252.eon: Improved standards compliance by fixing a source error
<li>253.perlbmk: added defines for Linux/S390 (32- and 64- bit); remove
    certain #undefs in spec_config.h, to allow portability defines;
    add some defines for glibc 2.2+ in spec_config.h and pp_sys.c.
</ul>

<h2>Tools new features</h2>

<p>Two new styles of line continuation are now supported in config 
files: line can be continued with either a single backslash (\) or 
with a double backslash (\\).
<ul>
<li>When a single backslash is used, the field is recorded with an
    embedded new line.  
<li>When a double backslash is used, the field is recorded with no
    new line, but with the second line appended to the first.
</ul>
The following example illustrates both features:<pre>
    OPTIMIZE = -verbose -feedback=compile_time \\
               -optimize_level=aggressive 
    notes100 = \\
       Crafty is compiled with both the compile-time  \
       feedback option and the aggressive optmization \
       option.
</pre>
The above example creates a single line for OPTIMIZE, with all
three switches (-verbose, -feedback, -optimize_level).  Also in the
example, notes100 is defined as three lines of text.
