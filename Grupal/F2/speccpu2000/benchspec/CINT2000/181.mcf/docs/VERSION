February 25, 1999, Reinhold Weicker (Siemens)
-----------------

Based on discussions with the author, he provided a new version of
mcf, in an effort to decrease the code locality somewhat
(to distribute "hot spots" somewhat more in the code).
The way he did it was to make some other parts of the program
"weight more", relative to the two most frequently executed lines.
I name this new version 303.mcf2, as a temporary alternative to 181.mcf.

It is intended that the CPU subcommittee members evaluate both
alternative and vote for one as the final candidate.
this final candidate will then be (re)named 181.mcf.

New version received from the author (his numbering: mcf-1.6), tested 
successfully and transmitted to SPEC.

New features: 
(1) Compared with the February version, it uses less memory:
Memory is allocated once at the beginning of the main run, enough
for the duration of the run.

(2) Through a new input set, ("ref") runtime has been made longer,
to satisfy the new minimum runtimes (>= 1200 sec on the SPEC reference
machine, assuming high optimization).


April 8, 1999, Reinhold Weicker (Siemens)

Following the discussions and decisions at the SPEC OSG meeting last week,
I make the new version of mcf (303.mcf2) the only version and change
its name (back) to 181.mcf.
In this process, I also reintroduce the modifications that were necessary for
NT (file defines.h), and clean up source file mcf.c and the output files
...../181.mcf/data/*/output/inp.out such that they do not contain "Umlaute" 
(in the name Loebel).


September 29, 1999, Reinhold Weicker (Siemens)
------------------

Following the discussion at the September SPEC meeting,
I added the following line to the master Makefile in 181.mcf/src:
	BENCHFLAGS = -DWANT_STDC_PROTO
The effect is that the following #define 
  #ifndef _PROTO_
  #if defined(__STDC__) || defined(__cplusplus) || defined(WANT_STDC_PROTO)
  #define _PROTO_( args ) args
is now active for all compilations, i.e. function prototypes are used
for all compilations.
Before this change, many compilers had it defined anyway (because
__STDC__ is predefined for them); several NT-based compilers explicitly needed
a portability flag -DWANT_STDC_PROTO; some may not have used
function prototypes.
After this change, no compiler should need an extra portability flag, and
all should now use function prototypes.

(Change to be integrated in version 1.01 of the suite)

In file $SPEC/benchspec/CINT2000/181.mcf/src/output.c, replaced line 40
  if(( out = fopen( outfile, "wt" )) == NULL )
by
  if(( out = fopen( outfile, "w" )) == NULL )
In file $SPEC/benchspec/CINT2000/181.mcf/src/readmin.c, replaced line 38
  if(( in = fopen( net->inputfile, "rt")) == NULL )
by
  if(( in = fopen( net->inputfile, "r")) == NULL )

Reason: One particular system could not compile in the original form;
all systems tested by SPEC could compile in the new form; no performance
difference.
