SPEC CPU2000 Benchmark Description File

Benchmark Name: 254.gap

Benchmark Author: Martin Schoenert

Benchmark Program General Category: Group theory, interpreter

Benchmark Description:

It implements a language and library designed mostly for computing in
groups (GAP is an acronym for Groups, Algorithms and Programming).

Input Description:

It has multiple parts, one part of it is the standard gap
speed-benchmark, excercising mostly the combinatorial functions and big
number library, then some test functions for the finite field,
permutation group and subgroup lattice computations, a program comparing
two different methods of finding normalizers in solvable groups and
finally a test excercising the collector for so-called ag-groups, this is
a piece where the bulk of the computation is not done by the interpreter.

Output Description:

The output consitsts of the results of these tests.

Programming Language: ANSI C

Known portability issues:

  The program has, in module system.c, several function prototype
  definitions for common Unix system calls. In case that these functions
  have already function prototypes defined by the compilation system,
  the program-supplied prototypes need to be deactivated to avoid
  multiple function definitions. This is done by supplying one or more of
  the following -D arguments as compilation switches for the compiler
  invocation command line:

  -DSYS_HAS_SIGNAL_PROTO
  -DSYS_HAS_TIME_PROTO
  -DSYS_HAS_SIGNAL_PROTO
  -DSYS_HAS_ANSI
  -DSYS_HAS_MALLOC_PROTO
  -DSYS_HAS_CALLOC_PROTO
  -DSYS_HAS_READ_PROTO
  -DHAS_STDIO_PROTO
  -DSYS_HAS_IOCTL_PROTO
  -DSYS_HAS_STRING_PROTO
  -DSYS_HAS_MEMSET_PROTO
  -DSYS_HAS_MISC_PROTO
   ...
 In addition, compilation switches of the form:
  -DSYS_IS_xxx
 control conditional compilaton for specific operating system dependent parts.
 The standard SPEC flag:
  -DSPEC_CPU2000_LP64
 deals with 64-bit integers and pointers.

 Please consult previous submissions and vendor config files if there are
 questions with portability.
