**
**  This file declares the functions of  GASMAN,  the  GAP  storage  manager.
**
**  Gasman is the  GAP storage manager.  That  means that the other parts  of
**  GAP  request  memory  areas  from Gasman.   These  are  then  filled with
**  information.  Gasman cares about the allocation of those memory areas and
**  the collection of unused areas.  Thus these operations are transparent to
**  the rest of GAP,  enabling the programmer to concentrate on his algorithm
**  instead of caring about memory allocation and deallocation.
**
**  The basic thing is  the bag.  This is simply  a continous area of  memory
**  containing any information, including references to other bags.  If a bag
**  contains  references to other bags these  references are collected at the
**  beginning of the bag.  A bag together  with all bags he references direct
**  or indirect, is called an object.  New bags are created with 'NewBag'.
**
**  When you  create  a bag using  'NewBag' this  functions returns  a unique
**  pointer identifying this bag, this  pointer is called  a handle and is of
**  type 'TypHandle'.  You  specify this handle  as  first argument to  every
**  storage manager function as first argument.  Variables containing handles
**  should begin with 'hd' to make the code more readable.
**
**  Every bag belongs to a certain type, specifying what information this bag
**  contains and how  bags of this type  are evaluated.  You specify the type
**  when creating the bag, you can retrieve it using the macro 'TYPE'.
**
**  Every bag has a size, which is the size of the memory area in bytes.  You
**  specify this size when you create the bag, you can  change it later using
**  'Resize' and retrieve it later using the macro 'SIZE'.

**  For  every type of bags  there is a symbolic  name defined for this type.
**  The types *must* be sorted in the following order:
**
**  Type of the non-printing object:       'T_VOID',
**  Types of objects that lie in a field:  'T_INT'      to  'T_FFE',
**  Types of objects that lie in a group:  'T_PERM'     to  'T_AGWORD',
**  Types of other unstructured objects:   'T_BOOL'     to  'T_FUNCINT',
**  Types of lists:                        'T_LIST'     to  'T_RANGE',
**  Type of records:                       'T_REC',
**  Extended types of lists (see list.c):  'T_MATRIX'   to  'T_LISTX'
**  Types related to variables:            'T_VAR'      to  'T_RECASS',
**  Types of binary operators:             'T_SUM'      to  'T_COMM',
**  Types of logical operators:            'T_NOT'      to  'T_IN',
**  Types of statements:                   'T_FUNCCALL' to  'T_RETURN',

**  Remaining types, order not important:  'T_CYCLE'    to  'T_FREEBAG',
**  First non assigned type:               'T_ILLEGAL'.
**
**  The types of  changable objects must  lie  between 'T_LIST' and  'T_VAR'.

**
**  The  types of all constants,  i.e., the types of all  objects that can be
**  the result of 'EVAL' must lie between 'T_INT' and 'T_VAR'.  They  are the

**  'EnterKernel' and 'ExitKernel'  are used by Gasman to  decide  which bags
**  are still used and which can be thrown away during  a garbage collection.
**  These functions are used   like brackets, i.e., for  every  'EnterKernel'
**  call there must follow exactely one corresponding 'ExitKernel' call.
**
**  All bags created before the first call to 'EnterKernel' are never garbage
**  collected.  This rule ensures that  all bags that  are created during the
**  initialization like   the identifier  table  bag are  never  thrown away.
**  Together with the  rule  that  no subobject of   a  used object  is   not
**  collected this ensures that no object  that has a  name at the GAP level,
**  i.e., that is a subobject in the identifier table is thrown away.
**
**  A bag created  after a call to 'EnterKernel'  is not collected before the
**  corresponding 'ExitKernel' call. This rule ensures  that no bag is thrown
**  away before it could be entered into a superobject.
**
**  If the handle passed to 'ExitKernel' is not 0 it is treated as though the
**  corresponding bag has been created after  the 'ExitKernel' call.  This is
**  important to save the result of a computation.

**  If the handle passed to 'ExitKernel' has the special value 2, this  means
**  an error occured and the user quitted to  the  main  read-eval-print-loop

**  call and their subobjects are canidates for collection.  I.e.,  it  works
**  as a meta-bracket closing all open 'EnterKernel' brackets.
