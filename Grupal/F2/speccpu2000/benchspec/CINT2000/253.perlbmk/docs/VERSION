Partial history of versions, modifications for CINT2000 benchmark 253.perlbmk

1 Apr 1999
==========
Updated to CPU2000.  No, it's not an April Fool.

26 Feb 1999
===========
(Kit 63 changes)
Removed the dup.t test from the test workload, since it would want to use
cat(1) on NT.  The features it tests for are not used in any of the
workloads (and the features do actually work, but we don't want to have any
external program dependencies).

Also removed external program dependencies from other tests.  Test
functionality wasn't affected.

(Kit 62 changes)
Added rand.t to the test workload to catch errors caused by incorrect
configuration (byteorder, etc) more quickly than running the ref input.

Converted random number stuff from int to SPEC_INT32_T.  This shifts the
burden of what to do about machines with 64-bit ints to the people who
have them, and not me.

Reorganized spec_config.h a little, so that the most commonly tweaked
options are at the top.

25 Feb 1999
===========

(Kit 61 changes)
Coverted the last instances of localtime in the Perl part of the reference
workload to gmtime.  Tested with TZ set to CDT (UTC-5), WET (UTC+2),
WFT (UTC+1).  This is why ref failed for Siemens and nobody else.

Fixed up spec_config.h for Alpha Linux (missing SPEC_CPU2000_LP64 definition)
and SCO UW2.
