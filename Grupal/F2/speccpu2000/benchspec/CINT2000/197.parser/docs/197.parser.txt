Benchmark Description:

  The Link Grammar Parser is a syntactic parser of English, based on
  link grammar, an original theory of English syntax. Given a
  sentence, the system assigns to it a syntactic structure, which
  consists of set of labeled links connecting pairs of words.

  The parser has a dictionary of about 60000 word forms. It has
  coverage of a wide variety of syntactic constructions, including
  many rare and idiomatic ones. The parser is robust; it is able to
  skip over portions of the sentence that it cannot understand, and
  assign some structure to the rest of the sentence. It is able to
  handle unknown vocabulary, and make intelligent guesses from context
  about the syntactic categories of unknown words.

Input Description:

  The input is a sequence of proposed sentences, one per line.
  Punctuation and case matter.

Output Description:

  The output is an analysis of the proposed input sentence.  The
  analysis includes a set of links which capture the grammatical
  structure of the sentence, a labelling of each word with an
  appropriate part of speech tag, along with a judgement of the
  grammaticality of the input sentence.  Words in square brackets are
  ones that the parser deems superfluous.

Programming Language:

  The parser is written in ANSI C.

Known portability issues: None
