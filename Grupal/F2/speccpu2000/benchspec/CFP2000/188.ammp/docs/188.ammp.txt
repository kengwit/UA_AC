SPEC CPU2000 Benchmark Description File

Benchmark Name: 188.ammp

Benchmark Author: Robert W. Harrison

Benchmark Program General Category: 
Computational Chemistry.  Modeling large systems of molecules usually
associated with Biology.

Benchmark Description: 
The benchmark runs molecular dynamics (i.e. solves the ODE defined
by Newton's equations for the motions of the atoms in the system) on a
protein-inhibitor complex which is embedded in water (see Harrison 1993 for
descriptions of the algorithm and stability analysis on it). The energy is 
approximated by a classical potential or "force field".   The protein is
HIV protease complexed with the inhibitor indinavir.  There are 9582 
atoms in the water and protein making this representative of a typical 
large simulation.  This benchmark is derived from published work on 
understanding drug resistance in HIV (Weber and Harrison 1999).

Input Description: The problem tracks how the atoms move from an initial 
coorinates and initial velocities.

Output Description: 
The output is the energy of the final configuration of atoms.

Programming Language: C

Known portability issues: none
