SPEC CPU2000 Benchmark Description File

Benchmark Name: 301.apsi

Benchmark Author: Zaphiris D. Christidis, IBM Yorktown Heights

Benchmark Program General Category: Weather Prediction

Benchmark Description:

  Program to solve for the mesoscale and synoptic variations of potential
  temperature, U AND V wind components, and the mesoscale vertical velocity
  W pressure and distribution of pollutants C having sources Q.  The
  synoptic scale components are in quassi-steady state balance, while the
  mesoscale pressure and velocity W are found diagnostically.

  The solution of the complete system is performed by using the
  splitting-up method.  In specific the horizontal advection is carried out
  by an explicit leapfrog scheme, the horizontal diffusion is performed by
  the method of the eigenvalues, or equvalently by vertical multiplying the
  fourier coefficients by appropriate exponentials.  The vertical diffusion
  is treated with a semi-implicit pade-crank-nickolson, as well as the
  vertical advection.  The pressure derivative terms are treated with the
  so-called pressure averaging technique.  Finally other terms will be
  dubbed in the advection part (coriolis).  The model calculates
  prognostically the the potential temperature, U,V wind components and
  concentrations of pollutants C (POTT,UX,VY,C).  The pressure and the
  vertical velocity will be calculated diagnostically (PRES,WZ).  The
  diffusivities are also calculated diagnostically using information on
  UX,VY, POTT.
