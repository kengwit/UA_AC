Benchmark Name: SIXTRACK

Benchmark Author: Frank Schmidt

Benchmark Program General Category: 
         High Energy Nuclear Physics Accelerator Design

Benchmark Description:
         The function of the program is to track a variable number
         of particles for a variable number of turns round a model
         of a particle accelerator such as the Large Hadron Collider
         (LHC) to check the Dynamic Aperture (DA) i.e. the long 
         term stability of the beam.

Input Description:
         The input data defines the number of particles (60) to be 
         tracked, the LHC accelerator components and geometry, the 
         initial conditions of the accelerator and particles , and 
         the number of turns to be tracked (variable according to 
         required workload, test, train or ref).

Output Description:
         The output starts with a report of the input data 
         describing the accelerator components and topology. The 
         initial conditions and tracking parameters follow. Next 
         come the results of the pre-processing including the closed 
         orbit and a check on the symplectic condition. The initial 
         and final co-ordinates of each particle are then reported, 
         with a possible intermediate report every 50,000 turns.

         A binary file is written, one per particle, reporting the 
         initial, intermediate, and final co-ordinates.
