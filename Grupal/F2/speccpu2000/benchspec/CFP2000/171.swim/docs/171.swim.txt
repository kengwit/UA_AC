SPEC CPU2000 Benchmark Description File

Benchmark Name: 171.swim

Benchmark Author: Paul N. Swarztrauber

Benchmark Program General Category: Meteorology: Shallow Water Modeling

Benchmark Description:

  Benchmark weather prediction program for comparing the performance
  of current supercomputers.  The model is based on the paper,
  "The Dynamics of Finite-Difference Models of the Shallow-Water Equations",
  by Robert Sadourny, J. ATM. SCIENCES, VOL 32, NO 4, APRIL 1975.

  Adapted by SPEC for use in the SPEC CPU Suites as an example of
  a compute intensive floating point program that was once relegated
  only to "supercomputers" but can now be done on current computer
  systems.

Input Description: It does a 1335x1335 area array of data and iterates over
		   512 timesteps.

Output Description: It prints the diagonal elements of the velocity field.

Programming Language: Fortran 77

Known portability issues: None.
