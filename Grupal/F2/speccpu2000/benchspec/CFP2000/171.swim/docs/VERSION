9/94    Reinhold Weicker - Start of log.

Versions before SPEC adaption:

      CODE BY PAUL N. SWARZTRAUBER, NATIONAL CENTER FOR
      ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH, BOULDER, CO,  OCTOBER 1984.

      MODIFIED BY R. K. SATO, NCAR, APRIL 7, 1986 FOR MULTITASKING.

Versions after SPEC adaption:

Update during 1993:

      Modified by Bodo Parady for the SPECpar suite.  Various
      compilation sizes added.  Iterations reduced to orginal
      problem, but size increased 4x in each dimension.

Update Sept. 21, 1994 (Reinhold Weicker, SNI):

      Further modified by Reinhold Weicker (Siemens Nixdorf) for the
      SPEC CFP95 suite:
      Changed back to the form with PARAMETER statements for
      N1 and N2, set N1 = N2 = 1025.
      The execution time is determined by these values and the
      variable ITMAX (number of iterations) read from the input file.
      Execution time is linear in ITMAX.

Updates during benchathon, Sept. 26-30, 1994 (Reinhold Weicker, SNI):

      Corrected character constant in line 46: Must be non-empty string
      Some participants reported that the execution time should be longer.

Update Oct. 6, 1994, Reinhold Weicker, SNI:

      Increased execution time by changing the input variable ITMAX from
      240 to 300. However the FP output values did not change (!).
      The problem size (PARAMETER's N1, N2) could not be increased since
      otherwise, the benchmark would get into paging/swapping on systems
      with less than 64 MB real memory. Its size is already on the
      high side (58 MB).

Updates during benchathon, Nov. 7-11, 1994 (Reinhold Weicker, SNI):

      Changed PARAMETERs N1 and N2 (grid size) from 1025 to 513,
      to decrease the static data size and, consequently, to prevent 
      To compensate for this change and to still have reasonable
      execution time, changed ITMAX to 900 (In the pre-SPEC version,
      it had been 1200).
     
Updates in July 1997 for submission to SPEC CPU98 by Bodo Parady, Sun

	Changed PARAMETERs N1 and N2 (grid size) from 513 to 1065,
	to increase the static data size to just less than 128MB, the
	new target size for CPU98.

	The iteration counts are still the same, with the difference
	in the output to print more intermediate results to
	prevent rampant constant propagation, and to prevent
	reduction of the interation since the interation to iteration
	output as printed does not change at all.


August 1998
	Bodo Parady
	Shorted workload by about 1/8 to near 5min on the reference
	machine



October 1998
	Bodo Parady
	Longer input set by factor of 2.7 to near 12min on reference

March 1999
	Bodo Parady
	Longer runtimes on ref machine.  Upped iterations from
	275 to 350.
