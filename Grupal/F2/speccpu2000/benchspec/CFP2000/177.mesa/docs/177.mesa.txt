SPEC CPU2000 Benchmark Description File

Benchmark Name: 177.mesa

Benchmark Author: Brian E. Paul

Benchmark Program General Category: 3-D graphics library

Benchmark Description: Mesa is a free OpenGL work-alike library.  Since 
it supports a generic frame buffer it can be configured to have no 
OS or window system dependencies.  Any number of client programs can be 
written to stress FP, scalar or memory performance (or a mix).  Output 
can be written to image files for verification.

Input Description: The input data is a 2D scalar field.  The scalar data
is mapped to height, creating a 3D object with explicit vertex normals.
Contour lines are mapped onto the object as a 1D texture.

Output Description: A 2D image file in PNG (pronounced "ping") format.

Programming Language: ANSI C

Known portability issues: None
